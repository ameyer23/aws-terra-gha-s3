    "# Terraform AWS Infrastructure Setup and GitHub Actions Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary of Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create Repo and Clone to Local Machine**  \n",
    "   Created a new repository and cloned it locally for development.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add AWS Access Keys as GitHub Secrets**  \n",
    "   - Navigated to **Settings > Secrets > Actions** in the GitHub repo.  \n",
    "   - Created two repository secrets:  \n",
    "     - `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` with the AWS access key value.  \n",
    "     - `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with the AWS secret key value.  \n",
    "   This allows GitHub Actions (GHA) to interact with AWS securely.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build Infrastructure with Terraform Locally**  \n",
    "   - Created a `src` folder to contain Terraform template code.  \n",
    "   - Inside `src`, created `main.tf` file with AWS provider setup:\n",
    "     ```hcl\n",
    "     terraform {\n",
    "       required_version = \">=0.13.0\"\n",
    "       required_providers {\n",
    "         aws = {\n",
    "           source  = \"hashicorp/aws\"\n",
    "           version = \"~>3.0\"\n",
    "         }\n",
    "       }\n",
    "     }\n",
    "\n",
    "     provider \"aws\" {\n",
    "       region = \"us-east-1\"\n",
    "     }\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create Modules for Terraform State Management**  \n",
    "   - Inside `src`, created `modules/tfstate` folder.  \n",
    "   - In `modules/tfstate`, created:  \n",
    "     - `main.tf` with Terraform provider setup (same as above).  \n",
    "     - `tfstate.tf` defining S3 bucket, versioning, encryption, and DynamoDB table for state locking:  \n",
    "       - S3 bucket resource with versioning and AES256 encryption.  \n",
    "       - DynamoDB table `terraform-state-locking` for Terraform state lock management.  \n",
    "     - `variables.tf` for bucket name and related variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add Terraform Module in `src/main.tf`**  \n",
    "   - Added the `tfstate` module reference in `src/main.tf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Run Terraform Locally**  \n",
    "   - Initialized, validated, and applied infrastructure with:  \n",
    "     ```bash\n",
    "     terraform init\n",
    "     terraform validate\n",
    "     terraform apply\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Encountered a naming conflict with the S3 bucket.  \n",
    "   - Resolved by using Terraform random resources to create unique bucket names.  \n",
    "   - When configuring the remote backend, variables were not allowed, so the bucket name was hardcoded with a unique value.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Configure Remote Backend**  \n",
    "   - Added an S3 backend block to `src/main.tf` to use the remote state bucket.  \n",
    "   - Ran `terraform init` again to reconfigure the backend.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Push Code to GitHub Main Branch**  \n",
    "   - Initial push failed due to large files (Terraform providers, etc.).  \n",
    "   - Fixed by adding `.terraform/` and state files to `.gitignore` to exclude them from Git.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Work From Main Branch Only**  \n",
    "   - All work was done on the `main` branch without additional branches.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Create VPC Infrastructure Module**  \n",
    "    - Inside `modules` folder, created `vpc` folder with:  \n",
    "      - `main.tf`  \n",
    "      - `variables.tf`  \n",
    "      - `outputs.tf`  \n",
    "      - `vpc.tf` files defining VPC resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. **Reference VPC Module in `src`**  \n",
    "    - Created a `locals.tf` file in `src` to define local variables for referring to the VPC module outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. **Initialize VPC Module**  \n",
    "    - Ran `terraform init` in `src` to initialize new module.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Set Up GitHub Actions (GHA) for Terraform Automation**  \n",
    "    - Created `.github/workflows` folder at the root of the repo.  \n",
    "    - Added `terraform.yml` workflow file for GHA to run Terraform commands automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Push Workflow to GitHub**  \n",
    "    - Ran:  \n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      git add -A\n",
    "      git commit -m \"Add Terraform workflow\"\n",
    "      git push\n",
    "      ```\n",
    "    - Checked the **Actions** tab on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "15. **Fix Terraform Format Error in GHA**  \n",
    "    - The initial GHA run failed due to code formatting.  \n",
    "    - Fixed locally by running:  \n",
    "      ```bash\n",
    "      terraform fmt\n",
    "      ```  \n",
    "    - Committed and pushed the formatted code again.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remote backend configuration requires the S3 bucket to exist before initializing Terraform state.  \n",
    "- Variables cannot be used in the backend block; bucket names must be hardcoded or templated before backend initialization.  \n",
    "- `.gitignore` should exclude `.terraform/`, `.tfstate` files, and provider binaries to avoid large file errors.  \n",
    "- Using GitHub Actions with AWS requires storing AWS credentials securely as repository secrets and using `aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials` in workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "*This document summarizes the full setup of Terraform AWS infrastructure, remote state management, and CI/CD integration with GitHub Actions.*\n"
